// TIFCE Pillar 1: Originality Score (Uniqueness)
// ================================================
// Purpose:
// - Measure how much a feed contributes indicators that are not already
//   broadly present across other feeds.
//
// Scoring logic:
// - Each IOC gets a weight of 1 / FeedCount
// - If only one feed has the IOC, it contributes 1.0 to that feed
// - If 5 feeds share the IOC, it contributes 0.2 to each feed
// - Feeds with more exclusive IOCs get higher originality scores

// Step 1: Build a deduplicated set of active IOCs per feed

    | summarize by TIFeed, IOC;
// Step 2: Count how many distinct feeds report each IOC
let IOCFeedCounts =
